## Getting Started

This is a working console application, written in Java that asks the user for the path to a CSV file name. It then converts the CSV data to JSON data that can be imported into NOSQL databases like Google Firebase.
## TODO: add a print statement to the loops to show progress. 
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
